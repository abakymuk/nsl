  "task_brief": "Task: Analyze the current quote request → quote response flow in this Next.js/Supabase app and produce a phased, implementation-ready plan to close the gaps described in the provided Expert Analysis. The plan should cover customer-facing status/acceptance, internal admin queue/prioritization, notifications, pricing breakdowns, and metrics/tracking.\nConstraints:\n- Plan only; do not modify code.\n- Use existing stack: Next.js App Router, Supabase, Resend, Slack; propose minimal, explicit schema changes when required.\n- Include security/privacy considerations for public status/accept links (tokenized URLs, expiration, audit trail).\n- Address Tier 1–3 improvements and identify dependencies, risks, and test/validation steps.\n- Assume current functionality is as implemented in repo files; do not invent features not in code unless proposing them as new work.\nRepo root: .\nRelevant paths:\n- README.md\n- app/quote/page.tsx\n- app/quote/quote-form.tsx\n- app/quote/thank-you/page.tsx\n- app/api/quote/route.ts\n- app/api/admin/quotes/[id]/route.ts\n- app/admin/quotes/page.tsx\n- app/admin/quotes/[id]/page.tsx\n- app/admin/quotes/[id]/quote-actions.tsx\n- app/api/track/route.ts\n- supabase/migrations/015_quote_lead_qualification.sql\n- types/database.ts\nNotes: Current flow: quote form inserts into Supabase (if configured) and sends email/Slack; admin quotes UI is a flat list + detail actions; track endpoint can show quote status via container number. Plan should extend this to a full quote status/accept flow and prioritized admin queue.",
